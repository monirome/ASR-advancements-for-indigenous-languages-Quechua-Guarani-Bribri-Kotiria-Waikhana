# ASR-advancements-for-indigenous-languages-Quechua-Guarani-Bribri-Kotiria-Waikhana

This repository contains the code and models for performing inference with fine-tuned Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems developed for Quechua, Guarani, Bribri, Kotiria and Wai'khana indigenous languages. The models were trained as part of the research presented in our paper "ASR advancements for indigenous languages: Quechua, Guarani, Bribri, Kotiria, and Waâ€™ikhana".

## Project Structure

- `0_build_docker.sh`: shell script to build Docker images
- `1_Inference.sh`: sheel script to  run inference processes.
- `/docker`: holds the dockerfile and associated scripts required to containerize the ASR system.

## Available Models

This repository contains fine-tuned models for the Quechua, Guarani, Bribri, Kotiria, and Wa'ikhana languages, which are necessary for running inferences. These models are available for download at the following Mendeley Data links:

- Guarani: [Download Guarani Model](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hcw7vhydpv/1)
- Bribri: [Download Bribri Model](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8dn49kxpz5/1)
- Kotiria: [Download Kotiria Model](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xd3h454tvd/1)
- Wa'ikhana: [Download Wa'ikhana Model](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/yczy43n594/1)

## Running Inference

First, build the Docker container using the provided script. This prepares the necessary environment, including all dependencies.
```bash
./0_build_docker.sh
```
Execute the inference script using the Bribri language model and data paths as an example:
```bash
./1_Inference.sh /data/bribri/bribri_model.pt /data/bribri/transcriptions/ /data/bribri/
```
